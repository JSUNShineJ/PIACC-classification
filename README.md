# PIACC-classification
This project builds supervised classification models on part of PIAAC dataset, Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers were then trained on the cleaned dataset. To address class imbalance, SMOTE-based oversampling (k = 5) was applied to the Random Forest models to enrich minority-class patterns. Model performance was evaluated using cross-validation.
